# Caesar-Cipher

Caesar Cipher is an encryption and decryption method where letters in a text are shifted by a certain number of places in the alphabet. 

Utilizing python, I used this method to: 
Ordered List :-
1. Select a message and shift value (k) to encode
2. Define two functions, one to encrypt and one to decrypt
3. Shift each letter in the message by "k" letters. If the shift goes past the last letter in the aphabet (z), it looks back to the first letter (a)

<br>This cipher takes two command-line arguments: the message to be encrypted/decrypted and the key (k).
